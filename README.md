This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Tasks Progress

1. **Smooth Execution**: The project development went smoothly, with a focus on maintaining consistency and efficiency throughout the process.

2. **Folder Structure**: A simple and standard folder structure was established to organize the project files effectively. This structure ensures clarity and ease of navigation for both current and future contributors.

3. **Library Integration**: The required libraries were successfully integrated into the project. This step ensures that the project benefits from essential functionalities and capabilities provided by these libraries.

4. **Alpha Implementation**: The alpha version of the project has been implemented, complete with dummy data. This initial implementation serves as a foundational step, allowing for further development and testing.

5. **Localization**: I have recently implemented localization in one of my previous projects, [Frnz](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frnz.app&hl=en&gl=US). Feel free to check out the project to see the localization in action as I've didn't got much time to implement Localization.
